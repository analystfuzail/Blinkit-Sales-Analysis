ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Blinkit is a fast-growing quick-commerce company that delivers groceries and daily essentials within minutes.
As the company expands its operations, decision-makers face challenges in identifying which products, regions, and categories contribute most to overall sales and profitability.

Additionally, there is limited visibility into customer buying patterns, delivery performance, and revenue trends, which impacts marketing, inventory management, and business forecasting.

To address this, the goal is to design an interactive Power BI dashboard that empowers the business team to:

âœ… Track sales performance across products, regions, and time periods
âœ… Monitor delivery efficiency and average order value
âœ… Identify top-performing and underperforming products or categories
âœ… Analyze customer behavior and purchasing trends
âœ… Support data-driven decisions to enhance profitability and operations
