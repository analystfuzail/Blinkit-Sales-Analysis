# ðŸ§  Problem Statement:

Blinkit (formerly Grofers) is a fast-growing quick commerce company that delivers groceries and daily essentials within minutes. As the company expands its operations, decision-makers struggle to identify which products, regions, and categories contribute most to sales and profitability.

Additionally, thereâ€™s limited visibility into customer buying patterns, delivery performance, and revenue trends, which affects business planning, marketing, and inventory management decisions.

->Hence, there is a need for an interactive Power BI dashboard that helps the business team:

âœ…Track sales performance across products, regions, and time periods,

âœ…Monitor delivery efficiency and average order value,

âœ…Identify top-performing categories and underperforming items,

âœ…Understand customer behavior and trends, and

âœ…Support data-driven decisions to improve operations and profits.
